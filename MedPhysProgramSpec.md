Goal of the program:
Learn concepts of compton scattering

Program specs:
Uses python
For all plots use dark themes
Make sure to display all equations in Latex

Concepts to teach:
Show how compton scattering changes with energy and Z from energies of 1 keV to 20 MeV

We want a selection box to try different energies and materials with an associated plot. 

Add any additional functionality that you think will be useful to have.

Return a single python file for this example
