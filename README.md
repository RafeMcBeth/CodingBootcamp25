# CodingBootcamp25

This repository contains learning materials for Python programming aimed at graduate medical physics students. The `python_tutorial` directory includes scripts demonstrating loops, object-oriented design, dataclasses, command-line arguments, and debugging with `pdb`.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run the example scripts:

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd CodingBootcamp25/python_tutorial
python3 basic_operations.py
python3 oop_radiation.py
python3 dose_analysis.py sample_doses.csv
python3 half_life_decay.py Co60 1925 3.7e10 24
python3 debug_example.py  # Demonstrates the debugger
```

These examples highlight how Python can be used for calculations and simple automation tasks common in medical physics.
