# Medical Physics Project Ideas

Below are ten small project ideas for students to explore after completing the bootcamp. Each project should focus on a single concept and result in a simple command-line or GUI application.

1. **Half-Life Calculator** - Compute the remaining activity of a radionuclide over time and visualize the decay curve.
2. **CT Number Histogram** - Load a CT slice and plot the histogram of Hounsfield Units with basic thresholding options.
3. **Radiation Shielding Estimator** - Calculate the required thickness of common shielding materials for a given energy.
4. **Isodose Plot Generator** - Produce a 2D heatmap of dose distribution from a set of discrete dose points.
5. **Simple DICOM Viewer** - Display basic image information and allow window/level adjustments using `pydicom` and `matplotlib`.
6. **Gamma Counter Efficiency** - Analyze efficiency calibration data and fit an efficiency curve for a gamma counter.
7. **Treatment Timer** - Given a desired dose, compute how long to run a radiation source at a given dose rate, including safety warnings.
8. **Contrast-to-Noise Ratio Calculator** - Measure CNR from a phantom image and report on image quality.
9. **Interactive Beam Plotter** - Visualize the shape of a radiation beam and allow users to adjust parameters like field size and distance.
10. **Radiation Quiz Game** - A text-based quiz that tests knowledge of radiation physics with multiple-choice questions.
